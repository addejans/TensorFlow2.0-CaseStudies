- In this project, I will build a simple machine learning model to convert from celsius to fahrenheit. 
- The equation is as follows: **T(°F) = T(°C) × 9/5 + 32**
- For example, let's convert 0°C celsius temperature to Fahrenheit:  **(0°C × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F**


*Note: the purpose of this project is to familiarize with TensorFlow 2.0. This is intended to be the simplest model possible; one neuron (i.e. one weight and one bias).*

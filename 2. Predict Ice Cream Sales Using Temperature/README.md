You own an ice cream business and you would like to create a model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside air temperature (in degrees Celsius). You decided to build a simple Artificial Neural Network to solve this problem.

Data set:
	Input (X): Outside Air Temperature
	Output (Y): Overall daily revenue generated in dollars

This simple regression example.
